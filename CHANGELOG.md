# Changelog

## v0.6.5

### Changed

- Stack overflow on any thread (not just 'rustc') is treated as an ICE.
  [#194](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/194)
- Clap (the CLI argument processor) has been updated, which may result in some minor CLI output and parsing changes.
  [#225](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/225)
  [#229](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/229)
- The check for the Rust upstream remote in the git repository has been loosened to only scan for `rust-lang/rust` so that non-https remotes like `git@github.com:rust-lang/rust.git` will work.
  [#235](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/235)
- The `--script` option will now look for a script in the current directory (so that it no longer requires the `./` prefix).
  [#236](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/236)
  [#238](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/238)
- Specifying `--start` without `--end` will default the end to be the current date. Previously it would use the date of whatever nightly is currently installed.
  [#240](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/240)

### Fixed

- Fixed using either `cargo bisect-rustc` (with a space) or `cargo-bisect-rustc` (with a dash).
  [#187](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/187)
- Show the CLI help page if no arguments are passed.
  [#206](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/206)
- The CLI argument validator for `--script` has been removed to allow running scripts on PATH. This also removes the `--host` validator which was not needed.
  [#207](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/207)
- Fixed showing the full chain of errors instead of just the top-level one.
  [#237](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/237)

## v0.6.4

### Added

- Added the `--component` option to choose optional components to install.
  [#131](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/131)
- An estimate of the number of steps left to run is now displayed.
  [#178](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/178)

### Changed

- Various code refactorings and dependency updates. These shouldn't have
  significant noticeable changes.
  [#151](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/151)
  [#152](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/152)
  [#153](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/153)
  [#155](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/155)
  [#156](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/156)
- The `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET` environment variable is now set with the target triple.
  [#159](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/159)
- The default release profile now uses stripping and LTO to significantly
  reduce the binary size.
  [#157](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/157)
- Bounds with tags like `--start=1.62.0` are now translated to a nightly date
  instead of a master git commit. This allows using tags from releases more
  than 6 months old.
  [#177](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/177)

## v0.6.3

### Fixed

- Fixed assumption that the rust-lang/rust remote repo is named "origin".
  [#149](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/149)

## v0.6.2

### Added

- `--start` and `--end` now support git tags (like `1.59.0`) to bisect between stable releases.
  [#147](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/147)

### Changed

- Stack overflow is now treated as an ICE.
  [#142](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/142)

## v0.6.1

### Added

- Added `--with-dev` option to download rustc-dev component.
  [#101](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/101)
- Added `--timeout` option to trigger a failure if compilation takes too long.
  [#135](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/135)

### Changed
- Use the `git` CLI to fetch the `rust-lang/rust` repo when looking for CI commits to improve performance.
  [#130](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/130)

### Fixed

- Fixed off-by-one error when examining the date of the local nightly toolchain.
  [#113](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/113)
- Fixed issue with `--preserve` when linking the nightly toolchain leaving a stale link.
  [#125](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/125)

## v0.6.0

### Added

- Support specifying the path to a rust-lang/rust clone at runtime with `RUST_SRC_REPO`

### Changed

- Use an anonymous remote that always points to rust-lang/rust when refreshing repository

### Fixed

- Add nightly start and end date validations against the current date â€“ previously would attempt to install nightly even if date was in the future
- Verify that `--test-dir` is a directory instead of assuming it is and then panicking
